[31m-> Vulnerability found in django version 5.1.4
[0m[1m   Vulnerability ID: [0m74985
[1m   Affected spec: [0m>=5.1.0,<5.1.5
[1m   ADVISORY: [0mAffected versions of Django are vulnerable to a potential
   denial-of-service attack due to improper IPv6 validation. The lack of upper
   limit enforcement for input strings in clean_ipv6_address,
   is_valid_ipv6_address, and the django.forms.GenericIPAddressField form field
   allowed attackers to exploit overly long inputs, causing resource exhaustion.
   The vulnerability is addressed by defining a max_length of 39 characters for
   affected form fields. The django.db.models.GenericIPAddressField model field
   was not impacted. Users should upgrade promptly.
